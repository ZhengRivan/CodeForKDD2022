# Supervised and Parametric Anomaly Detection (SPAD)

## For Simulation

We have gathered the code for simulating ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1) and implementing SPAD here [Simulation](https://github.com/ZhengRivan/CodeForKDD2022/blob/main/Simulation_V1.R). 

## For Real-World Case

Considring the data privacy and copyright, you can request the Yahoo Anomaly Benmark on your own[Yahoo Anomaly Benchmark](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=s&did=70), but we will provide two sample code for processing non-seasonal data `real_1` and seasonal data `real_16`
